I am a Research Staff Member at IBM Research in the MIT-IBM lab in Cambridge, MA.
I work on machine learning for science and theory of machine learning. Specifically, I focus on:
* Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
* Group equivariant neural networks
* Symmetries and conservation laws in gradient-based learning.   

See my [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gvHpUtgAAAAJ&hl=en) for recent papers.

Education Background
===
I obtained my PhD in physics at Boston University with Prof. Eugene Stanley in 2016. 
I have worked on a range of topics in physics, from black hole physics to 3D embedded physical networks (e.g. neurons in the brain).
